Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed failure when encountering overlapping content.
  `#593 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/593>`_


----


0.11.12 (2022-10-20)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Migration may stuck for many days when migrating an environment with massive number of rpms. This commit fixed the issue.

0.11.11 (2022-06-06)
====================

Bugfixes

- Fixed issue where migration.py passes a Content object to remove_content(),
  which ends up breaking pulpcore's remove_content() further down the line with
  a traceback stating, 'Content' object has no attribute 'count'.

  Pulpcore's remove_content() will not face this issue anymore as it will now
  always receive a QuerySet object from migration.py.
